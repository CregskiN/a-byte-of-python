## 关于Python

Python是一种公认的简洁、强大的编程语言。你将会发现“专注于解决问题”而非“疲于编程语言的语法和结构”是多么简单。
Python官方介绍中提到：

> Python是一种易学、强大的编程语言。它支持高效的高级数据结构，并且以一种简洁而高效的方式，支持面向对象编程。优雅的语法、动态类型以及解释性的特点，使Python成为一种跨平台、脚本和快速构建app的理想语言。

我将会在下一小节更详细讨论这些特性。



## 名字背后的故事

**Guido van Rossum**——Python的创造者，在BBC的节目"Monty Python's Flying Circus"结束之后为Python命名。他特别不喜欢那种通过缠绕并碾碎猎物的身体来获取食物的蛇。



## Python的特性

### 简单

Python是一种简洁的语言。阅读Python代码就好像直接阅读英文，尽管英文非常严谨！伪代码性质是Python众多优点之一。Python促使你专注于解决问题而非语言本身。

### 易学

正如你看到的，Python非常易上手。如前所述，Python语法非同寻常的简单。

### 免费和开源

Python is an example of a *FLOSS* (Free/Libre and Open Source Software). In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs. FLOSS is based on the concept of a community which shares knowledge. This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been created and is constantly improved by a community who just want to see a better Python.

### 高级语言

When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about the low-level details such as managing the memory used by your program, etc.

### 便携

Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported to (i.e. changed to make it work on) many platforms. All your Python programs can work on any of these platforms without requiring any changes at all if you are careful enough to avoid any system-dependent features.

You can use Python on GNU/Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390, z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and PocketPC!

You can even use a platform like [Kivy](http://kivy.org/) to create games for your computer *and* for iPhone, iPad, and Android.

### 解释

This requires a bit of explanation.

A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted from the source language i.e. C or C++ into a language that is spoken by your computer (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a compiler with various flags and options. When you run the program, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.

Python, on the other hand, does not need compilation to binary. You just *run* the program directly from the source code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your computer and then runs it. All this, actually, makes using Python much easier since you don't have to worry about compiling the program, making sure that the proper libraries are linked and loaded, etc. This also makes your Python programs much more portable, since you can just copy your Python program onto another computer and it just works!

### 面向对象

Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming (OOP). In *procedure-oriented* languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In *object-oriented* languages, the program is built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but simplistic way of doing OOP, especially when compared to big languages like C++ or Java.

### 可扩展

If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to have some piece of algorithm not to be open, you can code that part of your program in C or C++ and then use it from your Python program.

### 可嵌入

你可以在*C/C++*程序中嵌入Python，为用户提供脚本功能。

### 海量的库

The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various things involving regular expressions,documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, FTP, email, XML, XML-RPC, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI (graphical user interfaces), and other system-dependent stuff. Remember, all this is always available wherever Python is installed. This is called the *Batteries Included* philosophy of Python.

Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries which you can find at the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi).

### 小结

Python is indeed an exciting and powerful language. It has the right combination of performance and features that make writing programs in Python both fun and easy.



## Python 3 与 2

You can ignore this section if you're not interested in the difference between "Python version 2" and "Python version 3". But please do be aware of which version you are using. This book is written for Python version 3.

Remember that once you have properly understood and learn to use one version, you can easily learn the differences and use the other one. The hard part is learning programming and understanding the basics of Python language itself. That is our goal in this book, and once you have achieved that goal, you can easily use Python 2 or Python 3 depending on your situation.

For details on differences between Python 2 and Python 3, see:

## 程序员们怎么说

你会发现阅读伟大的*hackers*如Eric S. Raymond (ESR) 对于Python的只言片语非常有趣

+ *Eric S. Raymond* is the author of "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" and is also the person who coined the term *Open Source*. He says that [Python has become his favorite programming language](http://www.python.org/about/success/esr/). This article was the real inspiration for my first brush with Python.
+ *Bruce Eckel* is the author of the famous 'Thinking in Java' and 'Thinking in C++' books. He says that no language has made him more productive than Python. He says that Python is perhaps the only language that focuses on making things easier for the programmer. Read the [complete interview](http://www.artima.com/intv/aboutme.html) for more details.
+ *Peter Norvig* is a well-known Lisp author and Director of Search Quality at Google (thanks to Guido van Rossum for pointing that out). He says that [writing Python is like writing in pseudocode](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1803815). He says that Python has always been an integral part of Google. You can actually verify this statement by looking at the [Google Jobs](http://www.google.com/jobs/index.html) page which lists Python knowledge as a requirement for software engineers.
